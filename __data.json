With this installation we try to inspire people and prepare them for a possible future by generating ads for 2032 with the help of AI generative models.\nFor this installation we made two stations with touchscreens to generate ads from the year 2032 based on a topic or brand of the users choice. At these stations users need to complete the sentence \"An ad for...\" as a starting point. The application then generates a slogan and images from 2032 using an AI algorithm based on GPT3 and Stable diffusion modules. Once the users are happy with their ad, they can download it to their phones by providing their email in exchange for a QRCode to download the file. They can also post the ad in a public interactive wall under an artistic name so that everyone can see it. This wall was set up using two big screens.\nIn order to achieve we had to do some prompt engineering to get ad like results.",{"bold":19,"italic":19,"strikethrough":19,"underline":19,"code":19,"color":30},{"id":79,"type":23,"rich_text":80},"v_%3FK",[],{"id":82,"type":82,"title":83},"title",[84],{"type":26,"text":85,"annotations":87,"plain_text":86,"href":15},{"content":86,"link":15},"Ad Generator",{"bold":19,"italic":19,"strikethrough":19,"underline":19,"code":19,"color":30},"https://www.notion.so/Ad-Generator-56b52d25096c4606a043a58d1291b4be","https://mrsousa.notion.site/Ad-Generator-56b52d25096c4606a043a58d1291b4be",{"object":3,"id":91,"created_time":92,"last_edited_time":92,"created_by":93,"last_edited_by":94,"cover":95,"icon":15,"parent":99,"archived":19,"properties":100,"url":140,"public_url":141},"f3f1a69d-0aac-4c04-b888-1ca4c10612f9","2023-10-16T18:14:00.000Z",{"object":7,"id":8},{"object":7,"id":8},{"type":11,"file":96},{"url":97,"expiry_time":98},"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0465e274-0ab3-47f0-bd80-6ea2fe6a000f/958a3825-1da3-4f61-acd1-7e0bdf77c389/logo.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20231016%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20231016T195826Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=a33f1479af9216d6306c65f1f65ee32918323e7c9de15cf695bdb0eaa9d186d1&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject","2023-10-16T20:58:26.548Z",{"type":17,"database_id":18},{"Caption":101,"Skils":107,"Media":109,"Repository":111,"Toolkit":113,"Featured":116,"Tags":117,"Date":120,"Client":121,"Role":122,"Property":124,"Description":126,"Responsability":132,"Name":134},{"id":22,"type":23,"rich_text":102},[103],{"type":26,"text":104,"annotations":106,"plain_text":105,"href":15},{"content":105,"link":15},"PaperPods is a web application that lets you create fun and engaging podcasts from your selected research papers using AI.",{"bold":19,"italic":19,"strikethrough":19,"underline":19,"code":19,"color":30},{"id":32,"type":33,"multi_select":108},[],{"id":36,"type":37,"url":110},"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldEhZBUkRxIQ2qD2321Ujf_vjrX8ImY8/view?usp=drive_link",{"id":40,"type":37,"url":112},"https://github.com/yupikaiei/paperpods",{"id":42,"type":33,"multi_select":114},[115],{"id":45,"name":46,"color":30},{"id":48,"type":49,"checkbox":50},{"id":52,"type":33,"multi_select":118},[119],{"id":55,"name":56,"color":57},{"id":59,"type":60,"date":15},{"id":62,"type":63,"select":15},{"id":65,"type":33,"multi_select":123},[],{"id":68,"type":69,"files":125},[],{"id":72,"type":23,"rich_text":127},[128],{"type":26,"text":129,"annotations":131,"plain_text":130,"href":15},{"content":130,"link":15},"PaperPods is a web application that lets you create fun and engaging podcasts from your selected research papers.
